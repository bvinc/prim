Prim Standard Library (experiment)

Layout:
- `src/` contains Prim modules arranged by directory.
- Import modules using dotted paths (e.g., `import std.string`).

Status:
- Early scaffold, not yet wired into CLI resolution. For now, copy or symlink needed modules next to your program's module root so `import std.string` resolves.
