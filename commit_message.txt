span: unify span handling across crates

- add prim-tok span module with Span, SpanBuilder, Spannable, and focused unit tests
- refactor tokenizer, parser, CLI, and typechecker to consume the shared Span API and adopt SpanBuilder for attribute tracking
- re-export span utilities through prim-parse so downstream crates compile without changes

Deviations from design.md: none.
